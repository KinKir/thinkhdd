The Debian Package thinkhdd
----------------------------

Based on
http://stahlke.org/dan/hdd_led
This package controls the 'i' LED on Thinkpads as a software controlled
disk activity indicator.

It monitors /proc/diskstats (which also shows activity to external drives)
and toggles /proc/acpi/ibm/led. This version has been updated with
signal handling and has a systemd unit file with automatic installation
and starting.
